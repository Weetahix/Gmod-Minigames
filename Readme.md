# Garry's Mod Minigames Gamemode
This gamemode was *not* created by me. I have extracted this gamemode for further improvements.

I haven't seen many minigame gamemodes out there since Roleplay gamemodes have taken over the server browser.

To install, simply add to the correct folders on your server, sync up the FastDL and enjoy. Maps are required to play. Look for mg_ maps.
